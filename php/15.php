/**
 * Iterates over a sequence of values using a for loop.
 *
 * Typically used to execute a block of code a specific number of times.
 * The loop consists of an initialization, a condition, and an increment/decrement expression.
 *
 * Example:
 * for ($i = 0; $i < $count; $i++) {
 *     // Code to execute on each iteration
 * }
 *
 * @var int $i Loop counter variable.
 * @var int $count Number of iterations to perform.
