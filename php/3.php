/*
Rule of variables in PHP:
- Variables start with a $ sign, followed by the name.
- Variable names must start with a letter or underscore, not a number.
- Variable names can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
- Variable names are case-sensitive ($var and $Var are different).
- Variables do not need to be declared before assignment.
- The value of a variable can change type at runtime (dynamic typing).
- Variables can store different data types: strings, integers, floats, arrays, objects, etc.
- Use meaningful variable names for better code readability.
