/**
 * Iterates over each element in an array or object using a foreach loop.
 * * This loop is specifically designed for iterating through collections, such as arrays or objects.
 * * It automatically assigns each element to a variable, allowing easy access to the value.
 * * Example:   
 * foreach ($array as $value) {
 * *     // Code to execute for each element
 * * }
 * * @var array $array The array or object to iterate over.
 * * @var mixed $value The current value of the element being iterated.
